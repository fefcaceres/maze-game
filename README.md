### Project 5: Maze Game

In the Silent Game, design is modeled as a social process of morphological change. The Maze Game is an attempt to redesign the Silent Game for computational media while preserving two fundamental characteristics of the Silent Game: collaboration and manipulation of expressive form.

This project was forked from (https://github.com/wwwtyro/Astray) in an effort to transform the game into a collaborative, multiplayer game for our final project in LMC 2700: Intro to Computational Media.
